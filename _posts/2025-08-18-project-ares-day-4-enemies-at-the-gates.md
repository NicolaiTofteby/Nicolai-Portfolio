T﻿oday I have been looking for enemies we can use for our project, our map is designed to look like grassfields so we decided to use a mushroom person as our first test subject. \
\
T﻿he mushrooms follows the person around and tries to hit the player if possible\
\
I﻿ had problems with the name in our project and fail managed to place it correctly so it tried to use the node instead of the character in the script, but when I moved the script it worked fine, just a small oversight on my part that was easily fixed
