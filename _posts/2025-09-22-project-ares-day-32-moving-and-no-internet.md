T﻿he past week I have been in the process of moving and haven't been able to do a lot of work on the game sadly.

I﻿ have cleaned up in our folders and scripts, I have deleted the different scripts for the enemies so they now run on one single script instead of all having a different one, now that the testing is over. I have also created a script to better handle the enemies and there different pools, because so far only one enemy had a script to run the pool, which was the RedMushroom, but not they all run on a EnemyPools node in Godot and the EnemyPool script now finds the currect Pool for each enemy based on their name.

I﻿ have plans on making the cleaning up in the lag again, I am still not sure what the problem is but while I don't have any internet till maybe Friday, I plan on setting up a lot of debuggers so I can see in the profiler where the spikes happens. And fix the problems afterwards, I will be looking into the problem and hopefully find a fix.
