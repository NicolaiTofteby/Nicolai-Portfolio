## W﻿hat’s been happening since last time?[](https://nicolaitofteby-portfolio.netlify.app/project-ares-day-12-the-golden-goose/#whats-been-happening-since-last-time "Permalink")

I﻿ have been working on the lighting and learning collision for the Tavern, it was nothing big but it did take some time, look in day 12 for more information.

I﻿ was told Wednesday that I got a new apartment, so I have been on and off working on the project and getting everything else ready for moving in 2 weeks time.

## W﻿hat have I learned?[](https://nicolaitofteby-portfolio.netlify.app/project-ares-day-12-the-golden-goose/#what-have-i-learned "Permalink")

I﻿ have learned about lightning and collision and I feel like I have made a lot of progress

## What challenges did I face?[](https://nicolaitofteby-portfolio.netlify.app/project-ares-day-12-the-golden-goose/#what-challenges-did-i-face "Permalink")

F﻿irst of all I tried making a shape based on my candles texture, but I quickly found out that, that wouldn't work. I then looked up a video on how lighting works and I found that a little out of the way, there is a way to make shapes, and I started shaping the lights for the candles and then went on to do the windows, which still aren't that good but it's a start and we will get back to it. Another problem I faced was collision, it was a little weird in the beginning but i'm quite proficient at it now thanks to help from my team

## How have I contributed to the project?[](https://nicolaitofteby-portfolio.netlify.app/project-ares-day-12-the-golden-goose/#how-have-i-contributed-to-the-project "Permalink")

I﻿ have updated the Tavern with lightning and collision so that it is useable

## U﻿I / UX and Gamification[](https://nicolaitofteby-portfolio.netlify.app/project-ares-day-12-the-golden-goose/#ui--ux-and-gamification "Permalink")

L﻿earning about Lightning was helpful, but that's about it for the UI and UX.

## W﻿hat I plan to do next:[](https://nicolaitofteby-portfolio.netlify.app/project-ares-day-12-the-golden-goose/#what-i-plan-to-do-next "Permalink")

F﻿or the tavern, we still need to limit the space a bit, and also work on an exit that takes you to a menu where you can pick the map you want to go to

N﻿ext week i'm gonna look into making more enemies

## R﻿eflections:[](https://nicolaitofteby-portfolio.netlify.app/project-ares-day-12-the-golden-goose/#reflections "Permalink")

I﻿ wish I had looked up a video a little quicker so I didn't spend way to long just looking around. It was fine doing trial and error but it took a little longer then what I would have liked it to
