## W﻿hat’s been happening since last time?

Since last time I have been thinking about what kind of enemies I want to add to the game. It should blend well in together with the Red Mushroom we already have but at the same time it should also be something new so that people feel like there is more then just that one type of enemy to attack, I haven't found anything specific but I believe this Frog that I found will do the job nicely (See pictures at the end)

## W﻿hat have I learned?

I﻿ haven't really learned anything new this time as it just been finding more enemies since last time. So I have just been scrolling through game assets I could find online

## What challenges did I face?

Again I haven't really faced any challenges as I have just been looking through game assets - I did have some problems with porting the frog into the game because you aren't allowed to duplicate scripts and other scenes because Godot makes a uniqe ID for almost everything in the engine so I had to change some scripts and I had to change the name of things in the files to make a new ID for assets that I had duplicated

## How have I contributed to the project?

I﻿ have made it possible to have more enemies in the game with different animations

## U﻿I / UX and Gamification

I﻿ learned about Visual cues and making sure that the visual differentiation is clear when it comes to different enemies. I looked into Layout Adjustments so that with more enemies on the screen I had to adjust the UI layout to avoid too much clutter

## W﻿hat I plan to do next:

I﻿ plan on adding some more enemies and work on adding them all together and see how it works when they work together and see if the gameplay becomes better or worse

I﻿ also plan on making them work on a timer so that I can decide at which times they should be added to the game. So lets say at about 1 min there have only been RedMushrooms so far, but after that one min, there will be Frogs as well. So that's what I will be working on for the next time

## R﻿eflections:

I﻿ could probably have shortened the work and done it all today but I am still in the process of moving so there was some stuff I had to do.
