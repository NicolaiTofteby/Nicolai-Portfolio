## W﻿hat's been happening since last time?

S﻿ince yesterday I have been building a Tavern design that I quite like, I have been working on some layering in the different assets so that the player can navigate through the Tavern without too much trouble. I still haven't made the collision yet, but I believe that will come when I have finished the Tavern, for now I have made the design that the team likes. I would like to look at lighting tomorrow, just try it out and learn about it



## W﻿hat have I learned?

I﻿ learned about layering and the best way to set them up for the future when they might be used again. 



## What challenges did I face?

I﻿ ran into a problem where I put all my layers inside of a the TileMap Node, instead of making invidual Layers (TileMap Layers). So I had to change almost everything and make new layers in the Tavern for it to work correctly.



## How have I contributed to the project?

I﻿ made our starting point (The Tavern) which is where the game starts when you first boot it up and where you come back to when you die or need to upgrade weapons or yourself



## U﻿I / UX and Gamification

I﻿ found that consistency matters a lot, such as the color coding and fonts should feel cohesive so it feels familiar to the player even when they are in a new scene



## W﻿hat I plan to do next:

I﻿ want to look at lightning and we are also gonna talk with our adviser tomorrow so he might have a few things to say as well



## R﻿eflections:

I﻿ like creating things, so I feel like this weekend and the first few days of the new week has been a delight for myself. I have been able to focus on another part of the game because we have made so much so quickly because it's just fun
