## W﻿hat’s been happening since last time?[](https://nicolaitofteby-portfolio.netlify.app/project-ares-day-25-enemy-pooling/#whats-been-happening-since-last-time "Permalink")

From November until now, I have mainly been focusing on my internship preparations and polishing different parts of our project. I worked on refining older systems, improving the presentation of features, and making sure everything as clear and ready for evaluation as possible\
During this period, I also conducted several playtests to collect feedback and identify where the user experience could be improved. Additionally, I worked on finishing system artifacts and improving documentation so it aligns better with the project goals.

## W﻿hat have I learned?[](https://nicolaitofteby-portfolio.netlify.app/project-ares-day-25-enemy-pooling/#what-have-i-learned "Permalink")

Over the past weeks, I learned how to better prepare material for both internship applications and school evaluations.\
I improved at reviewing my own work, identifying what needed polish, and making adjustments for quality and clarity.

Through playtesting, I learned how valuable user feedback is.\
I also learned to use feedback to refine UI, mechanics, and usability.

## What challenges did I face[](https://nicolaitofteby-portfolio.netlify.app/project-ares-day-25-enemy-pooling/#what-challenges-did-i-face "Permalink")

Balancing internship preparation with ongoing project improvements was a challenge.\
I had to split my time between polishing older work, responding to playtest findings, and preparing new documentation.

Another challenge was understanding how to present system artifacts in a way that clearly shows the workflow behind our project not just the final result.

Finally, interpreting and sorting player feedback required careful thinking. Not all feedback should be implemented, and I had to decide what actually improved the experience versus what could create new problems.

## U﻿I / UX and Gamification[](https://nicolaitofteby-portfolio.netlify.app/project-ares-day-25-enemy-pooling/#ui--ux-and-gamification "Permalink")

In UI/UX, I polished interface elements based on the playtest results. This included improving clarity, readability, icon placement, and usability.\
I focused on making the design feel more intuitive so new players understand the upgrades, the flow of the game, and how to navigate the interface.

From a Gamification perspective, I looked at how to make the player experience more rewarding by adjusting pacing, visual feedback, and progression clarity.\
The goal was to ensure upgrades feel meaningful and that the player always knows what they’re working toward.

## W﻿hat I plan to do next:[](https://nicolaitofteby-portfolio.netlify.app/project-ares-day-25-enemy-pooling/#what-i-plan-to-do-next "Permalink")

From now on till i'm done I have plans on working on my exam and I think this will be the last entry I make

## R﻿eflections:[](https://nicolaitofteby-portfolio.netlify.app/project-ares-day-25-enemy-pooling/#reflections "Permalink")

This period has been about refinement rather than creating new features.\
I realized that polishing, reviewing, and improving clarity is just as important as building the original systems.\
The playtests especially reminded me how differently players experience a game compared to developers — and how essential it is to watch real users interact with it.

Preparing for internships has also helped me how to present my skills more clearly and professionally.
