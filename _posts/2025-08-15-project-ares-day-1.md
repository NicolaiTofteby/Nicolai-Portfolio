W﻿e started the first day making a Trello board backlog with the first steps we expect to make for our game.

M﻿y plans for the weekend are making the map a little playable so we can run some tests when Monday comes around. 

I﻿'m also looking around online for more assets that makes sense for the game, right now Tilesets is what i'm looking for
