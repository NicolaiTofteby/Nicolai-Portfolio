T﻿he past 2 days have been spend on making a pause and settings menu. My coworker Nicolai B has been working on some bug fixes and a enemy spawn script\
\
A﻿s for the pause menu I had some problems with making it work as I wanted it to, I had to learn how the parents and child nodes worked together with the design and I figured it out as I went along\
\
R﻿ight now I'm working on making the resolution work, I don't want to go to bed before that is over as I promised myself and Nicolai I would get it done by the end of the day\
T﻿he problem I am facing is not that the script I made doesn't work, I can't test if it works because it doesn't allow me to change the size because ''Embedded window can't be resized.'' so i'm trying to find out how that works. \
\
I﻿ found this good read and I learned a few things even if that didn't fix my problem: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/rendering/multiple_resolutions.html
