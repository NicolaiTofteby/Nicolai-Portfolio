## W﻿hat's been happening since last time?

T﻿hroughout the weekend I have been working on finding some assets for the Tavern also called The Golden Goose. I think I found something that I would like to use, but as the creator has deleted his account and not able to reach him in any way I have found. I'm unsure if we should use it or not. But I have taken some other assets that looks promising in smaller parts. Today and tomorrow I will start working on the Tavern and see if I can make it look nice
