## W﻿hat’s been happening since last time?[](https://nicolaitofteby-portfolio.netlify.app/project-ares-day-25-enemy-pooling/#whats-been-happening-since-last-time "Permalink")

Since last time, I worked on expanding the documentation and theory behind the upgrade system in our game. I focused specifically on how to break down upgrades into deeper technical and design concepts for my exam. I also reviewed our earlier development work and reorganized it so the theoretical explanations match what we actually built in the game.

## W﻿hat have I learned?[](https://nicolaitofteby-portfolio.netlify.app/project-ares-day-25-enemy-pooling/#what-have-i-learned "Permalink")

This week, I learned how to describe game mechanics in a more advanced and academic way. Instead of only explaining what an upgrade does, I practiced connecting it to theory such as:

* **Game loops**
* **Progression systems**
* **Player agency**
* **Balancing and tuning**
* **Reward systems**

I also learned to separate the subject areas more clearly — for example, writing specifically about **UI/UX**, **Gamification**, and **Game Development** as three distinct sections. This made my explanations clearer and more structured.

Additionally, I gained more confidence in using proper terminology (e.g., *feedback systems, affordances, visual hierarchy, player incentives,* etc.), which is important for my exam.

## What challenges did I face[](https://nicolaitofteby-portfolio.netlify.app/project-ares-day-25-enemy-pooling/#what-challenges-did-i-face "Permalink")

One of the challenges this week was figuring out how to “go deep” when explaining upgrades. It’s easy to describe what they do, but much harder to bring in theory and show understanding of why they matter for player experience. 

Another challenge was deciding which game development terms were most relevant and how to use them correctly while still keeping the explanation readable. 

Lastly, separating UI/UX from Gamification and Game Development was harder than expected because they overlap  but breaking them apart improved the structure of my documentation.

## U﻿I / UX and Gamification[](https://nicolaitofteby-portfolio.netlify.app/project-ares-day-25-enemy-pooling/#ui--ux-and-gamification "Permalink")

In UI/UX, I worked on describing interface elements in more detail — how players identify upgrades, how labels and icons help with clarity, and how the layout affects navigation.

In Gamification, I focused on the motivational impact of upgrades:\
how they support player progression, how rewards are paced, and how they enhance the core feedback loop.

I also examined how our upgrade system keeps players engaged by offering visible and meaningful improvements.

## W﻿hat I plan to do next:[](https://nicolaitofteby-portfolio.netlify.app/project-ares-day-25-enemy-pooling/#what-i-plan-to-do-next "Permalink")

Next, I plan to refine my documentation even more and start preparing the design explanations I will need for the exam.\
I also want to finish polishing the upgrade descriptions so they are clear, structured, and tied to relevant theory.

After that, I will continue improving the game design elements we already created and apply the terminology directly to our project.

## R﻿eflections:[](https://nicolaitofteby-portfolio.netlify.app/project-ares-day-25-enemy-pooling/#reflections "Permalink")

This week helped me understand how important it is to communicate game design clearly.\
Knowing how to explain *why* something is designed in a certain way shows deeper understanding than just describing *what* it is.

I also realized that strong documentation helps me organize my thoughts and makes the exam process much easier.
