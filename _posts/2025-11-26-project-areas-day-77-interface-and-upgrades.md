## W﻿hat’s been happening since last time?[](https://nicolaitofteby-portfolio.netlify.app/project-ares-day-25-enemy-pooling/#whats-been-happening-since-last-time "Permalink")

Since last time, I continued developing and refining the user interface and upgrade system in our project. I also started working on collecting player feedback by creating a Google Form with structured questions about the gameplay experience, UI clarity, and overall game feel. This helped me focus on understanding how players interact with what we have built and how we can improve it further.

## W﻿hat have I learned?[](https://nicolaitofteby-portfolio.netlify.app/project-ares-day-25-enemy-pooling/#what-have-i-learned "Permalink")

This week, I learned how to design effective feedback questions that give useful information rather than just opinions. I understood how important it is to ask specific, guided questions so we can actually use the feedback to make improvements. I also strengthened my understanding of UI/UX principles through iteration. As I reorganised and evaluated our UI layout, I learned how small changes like button placement or visual grouping can help the player navigate and understand the game more intuitively. On top of that, I improved my ability to break down game mechanics (like upgrades) into clear categories and describe them using proper terminology for exams and documentation.

## What challenges did I face[](https://nicolaitofteby-portfolio.netlify.app/project-ares-day-25-enemy-pooling/#what-challenges-did-i-face "Permalink")

A challenge this week was figuring out how to ask the right questions for the Google Form so we could get constructive feedback rather than vague answers. Balancing simplicity with depth was harder than expected. Another challenge was identifying weaknesses in our UI without overthinking every tiny detail. It can be difficult to judge your own design work, so collecting outside feedback became necessary. Finally, organizing the upgrade system explanations for exam preparation took time because I needed to connect our practical work to theoretical concepts.

## U﻿I / UX and Gamification[](https://nicolaitofteby-portfolio.netlify.app/project-ares-day-25-enemy-pooling/#ui--ux-and-gamification "Permalink")

For UI/UX, I focused on improving clarity and structure. The upgrade lists, icons, and layout were reviewed to ensure players can quickly understand what each upgrade does. I also looked at consistency making sure similar elements follow the same visual logic. 

From a gamification perspective, I ensured that upgrades still align with player motivation loops. Clear progression, rewarding feedback, and visible improvement are key parts of keeping players engaged. The feedback form also ties into gamification because it helps us understand how players perceive progress, challenge, and rewards.

## W﻿hat I plan to do next:[](https://nicolaitofteby-portfolio.netlify.app/project-ares-day-25-enemy-pooling/#what-i-plan-to-do-next "Permalink")

Next, I will review the player feedback once responses come in and identify areas where the game can be improved. I also plan to refine older parts of our design and prepare more detailed documentation for my exam. If possible, I want to expand the upgrade descriptions and polish the UI flow even more.

## R﻿eflections:[](https://nicolaitofteby-portfolio.netlify.app/project-ares-day-25-enemy-pooling/#reflections "Permalink")

This week showed me how valuable player feedback is for improving both gameplay and UI/UX. It also helped me recognise that collecting and analyzing feedback is a skill in itself  one that is essential for professional game development. Overall, the work strengthened my understanding of how design, user experience, and player psychology are connected.
