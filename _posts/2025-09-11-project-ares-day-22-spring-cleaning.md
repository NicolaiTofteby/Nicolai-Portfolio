## W﻿hat’s been happening since last time?[](https://nicolaitofteby-portfolio.netlify.app/project-ares-day-12-the-golden-goose/#whats-been-happening-since-last-time "Permalink")

I﻿ have been sick for the past few days and haven't been able to do a whole lot when it comes to the project sadly but I will be working through he weekend to make up for any lost time

T﻿he team talked about wanting to clean up in the project a bit so I'm gonna be doing a little bit of that today. It won't be the biggest update today as I will just be cleaning up but let me tell you what have happened today\
\
I﻿ started by sorting things into different folders and already with doing that we had problems. In our code for certain things such as finding the player, we have a specific path to the folder it needs to go to which wasn't very reliable so I have changed that up a little bit I found some more bugs and I have also decided that next time I want to look into making a central script for the enemies instead of everyone having their own script\
\
I﻿ also found a snail that we can use and I will also be making some more copies of Mushrooms and frogs with different designs so that we have a bit more enemies just in different colors for different stages in the game\
\
B﻿ut that's what i'm gonna work on tonight and the rest of the weekend
