## W﻿hat’s been happening since last time?[](https://nicolaitofteby-portfolio.netlify.app/project-ares-day-25-enemy-pooling/#whats-been-happening-since-last-time "Permalink")

Since last time, I have been working on the theoretical part of our game development project. I focused especially on explaining the upgrade system we designed for our game, and how it connects to both game development concepts and UI/UX principles. I also worked on preparing material for my exam, where I had to break down our work into different categories like Game Development and Gamification.

## W﻿hat have I learned?[](https://nicolaitofteby-portfolio.netlify.app/project-ares-day-25-enemy-pooling/#what-have-i-learned "Permalink")

I learned how to describe game mechanics in a more detailed and professional way, including how upgrades affect gameplay, player progression, and balance. I also learned more about UX terminology such as visual hierarchy, clarity, affordances, and feedback loops and how these terms apply directly to our game’s interface. 

Additionally, I gained a better understanding of how to explain gamification elements like rewards, motivation, and player progression in a structured way.

## What challenges did I face[](https://nicolaitofteby-portfolio.netlify.app/project-ares-day-25-enemy-pooling/#what-challenges-did-i-face "Permalink")

A challenge I faced was figuring out how to clearly separate the topics UI/UX, Gamification, and Game Development, since they overlap in many ways. It took some time to phrase concepts so they fit into the right category and still made sense for the exam. Another challenge was going deeper into the technical explanation of the upgrade system  especially how to describe its purpose, its impact on the player, and how it connects to game design theory.

## U﻿I / UX and Gamification[](https://nicolaitofteby-portfolio.netlify.app/project-ares-day-25-enemy-pooling/#ui--ux-and-gamification "Permalink")

For UI/UX, I analyzed how our upgrade menu guides the player. I described how button placement, icons, and layout help make the menu simple and easy to use. I also looked at how we use visual cues to show upgrade levels and progression. For gamification, I focused on how the upgrade system creates motivation for the player. Things like increasing stats, visual feedback, and a clear progression path all contribute to player engagement. These mechanics help support long-term motivation and create a rewarding gameplay loop.

## W﻿hat I plan to do next:[](https://nicolaitofteby-portfolio.netlify.app/project-ares-day-25-enemy-pooling/#what-i-plan-to-do-next "Permalink")

Next, I plan to continue preparing for the exam by working on the remaining sections and refining the explanations. After that, I’ll work on improving older parts of the design — especially the upgrade UI and overall consistency of the user interface.

## R﻿eflections:[](https://nicolaitofteby-portfolio.netlify.app/project-ares-day-25-enemy-pooling/#reflections "Permalink")

I feel more confident talking about game development theory and connecting it directly to real examples from our project.
