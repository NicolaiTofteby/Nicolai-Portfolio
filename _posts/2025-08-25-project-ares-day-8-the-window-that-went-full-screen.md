I﻿ got some help online from people on a discord server who showed me that ‘‘Embedded window can’t be resized.’’ was a setting in the Game menu at the top (see image) that is normally on, so you can use the build in game window in Godot instead of opening a new window for the game. \
\
I﻿ turned it off and it just worked, my code was working as it should. But I ran into another problem that the resizing wasn't working properly, so I had to change some things and center the screen.\
\
I﻿ did spot another problem while working and that was the aspect ratio wasn't working as it should, so I put this whole thing on the shelf for now and decided to go back and work on the Tavern for the game. Which is suppose to be like a main hub for our character Lars to rest and learn new abilities, classes and buy upgrades from the Tavern keeper\
\
I﻿ have plans on learning a little about putting up different layers in a tile map, finding some new tilesets that I can use for the Tavern. I think we are gonna call it ''The Golden Goose'' for now.
