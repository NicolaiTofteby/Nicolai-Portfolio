T﻿oday I made a the map for the game, we needed a platform where we could run some tests such as collion, i'm planning on making new enemies tomorrow and see where that leads us\
\
I﻿ had a problem with Godot that it decided to crash and I lost a few hours progress, I went into the settings and changed the auto save to every 60 sec instead of me doing it manually
